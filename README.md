# Covid19_in_india-ML-AI
### This is a machine learning project which I try to work on a task which is predicting how well can the 21 day lockdown perform in containing spread of the virus?

#### Expected Prediction
The solution should contain a assumptions, a CSV file with date in column 1, affected patients (confirmed), new fatality (deaths) in the next two columns. But here I want to published my notebook or code for you :) 

#### What Datasets do we have?
* StatewiseTestingDetails.csv
* covid_19_india.csv
* covid_vaccine_statewise.csv

#### I have done this project by using:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Sickit Learn / Prophet
#### Remember:
I put it in 2 notebooks because of its length is too long and you should merge them into one notebook and use.
###### My last word:
Stay Home, Stay Safe!!!!!
