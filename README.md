# Covid19_in_india-ML-AI
### This is a machine learning project which I try to work on a task which is predicting how well can the 21 day lockdown perform in containing spread of the virus?
#### Task Details
* Prediction the number of new cases each day from March 26th to April 30th when the country is under lockdown
* Prediction the number of new cases each day from March 26th to April 30th in a hypothetical situation where there is no lockdown.


#### Expected Prediction
The solution should contain a assumptions, a CSV file with date in column 1, affected patients, new patients, new fatality (deaths) in the next three column. The solution should also contain the notebook or the code that was used to predict the output. Any other datasets used must be submitted. 

##### I have done this project by using:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Sickit Learn / Prophet

wish to be useful for you!
